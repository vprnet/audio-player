#VPR Webfaction Project Template
This stack is used by VPR to publish news apps and can be used for anything from building a blog to creating web applications.

This template assumes that your host is Webfaction and includes a good deal of VPR specific code. For a more generic template, see the [VPR App Template](http://github.com/vprnet/app-template) that was the basis for this template.
